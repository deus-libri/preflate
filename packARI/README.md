# packARI
A very basic compression tool for any file, mainly intended as base for bigger projects

packARI is a compression tool based solely on the core entropy encoding component used in all my other compression softwares (that means packJPG, packMP3, packPNM, …). On it’s own it might not achieve good results for some file types, but it makes for a great starting point when developing compression tools of your own.

The entropy coding in packARI has been tested since the beginning in all my other compression softwares, so it might be the most stable of them all.

You may freely use packARI and it’s source code under the terms of the LGPL.
